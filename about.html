            <p>
                Sunflower Cafe is more than just a coffee shop; it's a dream realized. 
                We are bringing a warm, country-cafe setting to the community, 
                serving fresh breakfast and lunch daily.

                "My journey of entrepreneurship has been an exhilarating decision, driven by passion, dedication, and unwavering determination. 
                Becoming a small business owner has been a lifelong dream fueled by a deep desire for independence, creativity, and personal fulfillment. 
                By infusing my expertise, creativity, and dedication into every aspect of my venture, I strive to create a unique and captivating culinary experience that leaves a lasting impression on customers. 
                As the proud owner of a food business in Opp, Alabama, and as a Black woman, I see my business becoming a prominent and inspirational presence within the community."
